# Your Minecraft Server Website Template

Welcome to the "Your Minecraft Server" website template! This template is designed to help you set up a website for your Minecraft server quickly and easily. It includes features such as a server status pinger and sections for server information, about us, and rules.

## Features

- **Server Status Pinger**: Displays the current status of your Minecraft server, including player count, ping, and online/offline status.
- **Easy Customization**: Change the main text by editing `index.php`, `about.php`, and `rules.php`.
- **PHP Structure**: The website is built using PHP for easy management of shared components like headers and footers.

## Customization Instructions

1. **Change Website Name**: 
   - Update the site name in `header.php` and in the meta title of each page (`index.php`, `about.php`, `rules.php`).

2. **Update the Server Logo**:
   - Replace `/assets/img/logo.png` with your own logo. Ensure the file name remains `logo.png` for the changes to take effect.

3. **Edit Content**:
   - Modify the content by editing the text in `index.php`, `about.php`, and `rules.php`.

4. **Change Anything Else**:
   - Youâ€™re free to change anything you want, especially if you have knowledge of HTML. The template is built with simplicity in mind, and you can modify it to fit your needs.

## Why PHP?

I initially built this template using PHP to manage common elements across pages (like headers and footers) easily. However, you're free to convert it to a static HTML site if you prefer.
